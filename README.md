# Autonomous Drone Path Optimization for Pomegranate Tree Pesticide Spraying

This project is designed to autonomously determine the most efficient path for a drone to spray pesticides over individual pomegranate trees in a large farm. Using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm, YOLOv5 for crop detection, and advanced image processing techniques, the tool calculates the optimal GPS-based path for the drone, ensuring efficient pesticide spraying.

## Features

- **TIFF Image Processing:** Input a high-resolution TIFF image of a pomegranate farm with GPS coordinates for precise tree detection.
- **Image Resizing and Slicing:** Resizes the image for efficient processing without losing critical data, followed by image slicing for quicker analysis.
- **YOLOv5 Crop Detection:** Runs YOLOv5 on each sliced image to detect individual pomegranate trees.
- **BBox Center Calculation:** Calculates and stores the center of the bounding boxes for detected trees to extract GPS coordinates.
- **Efficient Path Calculation:** Utilizes the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm to compute the most efficient path for the drone to spray pesticides.
- **GPS Path Extraction:** Extracts the GPS coordinates of the tree centers in the optimal path, enabling the drone to hover precisely over each tree.
- **Visual Path Display:** Displays the optimal drone path on the image, from the starting to the ending coordinates, input by the user.

## Methodology

1. **TIFF Image Input:**
   - Load a TIFF image of the pomegranate farm, containing over 600 trees, along with associated GPS coordinates.

2. **Image Resizing and Slicing:**
   - Resize the image for better processing efficiency without losing any important data.
   - Slice the image into smaller segments to allow faster processing through the YOLOv5 model.

3. **Crop Detection with YOLOv5:**
   - Detect pomegranate trees in each sliced image using the YOLOv5 model.
   - Overlap correction is applied to ensure accuracy when merging results from different slices.

4. **Bounding Box Center Calculation:**
   - For each detected pomegranate tree, calculate the center of its bounding box.
   - Store the calculated centers to extract the GPS coordinates for each tree.

5. **TSP Path Optimization:**
   - With all tree centers identified, use the TSP algorithm to calculate the most efficient spraying path.
   - The algorithm processes around 600+ trees and takes approximately 20 minutes to compute the optimal path.

6. **GPS Path Extraction and Visualization:**
   - After determining the most efficient path, extract the GPS coordinates for each tree.
   - Visually display the optimal path on the farm's image, starting and ending at user-specified coordinates.
